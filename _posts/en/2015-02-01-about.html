H1NT.me isn't simply a handbook or so, but your very personal hint for coding!
<p>
We've started this project in 2015, the year when almost every list of requirements for job applicants in web-develoment contains 
no less than 10-15 need-to-know programming languages, technologies and skills.
<p>
Today we have to deal with so huge amount of i—Çformation, that even if we learn something by heart we may forget some necessary details in the future. 
That's why we've created and developed an OpenSource project, which allows you to refresh information that might have slipped your mind.
<p>
Our long-term goal is to create a handy, helpfull website which contains cheatsheets from all over the world and everyboy will be able to use it.
<p>
The sourcecode of our project is available on <a href="https://github.com/h1ntme/h1ntme.github.io">GitHub</a>.
